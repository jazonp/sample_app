	<p>Fire	extinguishers	are	fairly easy	to use,	but	still	you	need to	familiarize	yourself with	its	usage	otherwise	you	will end up	causing	more harm	than good. During	fire emergency situation some	people have	the	tendency to	panic	which	oftentimes result	to uncoordinated reactions.	They get so	overwhelmed	by confusion that	they would miss	even the most	simple of	instruction	such as	using	extinguishers.</p><p>Emergency equipments	are	designed to	be user-friendly which simply	means	it does	not	take an	engineer to	correctly	use	it.	Considering	the	potential	of fires to	cause	colossal damage	and	high casualty, manufacturers of	fire extinguishers made	it point to	provide	easy to	follow instructions	on each	of their product.	In anticipation	of an	emergency	situation	wherein	memorized	instructions might be	forgotten	because	of panic,	the	instructions in	using	a	fire extinguisher	have been	summed up	for	easy recall. PASS	which	stands for pull, aim,	squeeze, and sweep is	the	acronym	coined after a careful consideration of	instructions found in	various	fire extinguishers.</p><p>Remember PASS	in case	of fire.
	<br>-	P	-	Pull the pin.	
	<br>-	A	-	Aim	at the base	of the fire. 
	<br>-	S	-	Squeeze	the	top	lever. 
	<br>-	S	-	Sweep	back and forth towards the fire</p><p>You	should stand several feet	from the fire	before squeezing the lever.	Once the lever is	depressed, aim at	the	base of	the	fire and sweep form	side to	side until the fire	is out.	There	have been	a	number of	cases	when fire	reignites	after	being	put	out, you should	refrain	from walking on	an area	where	fire has just	been put out.	You	should take	the	necessary	precaution when	using	carbon dioxide extinguishers.	Its	metal	parts	are	usually	dangerously	cold,	follow the instruction carefully or	have someone show	you	how	to use it.</p><p>There are other equally important reminders to	reckon with	when fighting	a	fire besides PASS. First and foremost, fire	fighting is	better left	to professionals.	Using	the	fight	extinguisher is	only advisable when	the	situation	will not in	any	way	put	you	in peril.	Use	extinguishers	when the fire	is small and contained.	Likewise,	you	should only	attempt	to fight a fire	when the fire	alarm	has	been activated and the fire	department is	being	contacted. It	is also	very important that	the	exit is	clear	for	an easy	way	out	when the situation worsen. Lastly, you need	to have	the	right	extinguisher for the type	of fire	you	need to	extinguish.</p><p>The	cardinal rule	in any emergency situation is	not	to let yourself	get	harmed least you become	a	casualty yourself. The next	best thing to	do is	to help	any	person in	immediate	danger to	safety.	It also	necessary	to contact the fire	department immediately because fires spread	fast as	the	temperature	within the vicinity	increases. Moreover, fire	extinguishers	are	designed to	fight	fires	at its early stage.</p><p>Fighting a fire	effectively	is a concerted effort	that involves	not	only the fire	fighters themselves	but	most specially those who are caught	at the scene or	at the crossfire so	to speak.	You	can	choose to	be a victim	or be	the	savior.	Who	has	the	right	fire extinguisher	wins.</p>	</div>
